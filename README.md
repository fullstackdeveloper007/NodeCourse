# üìå **Node.js Interview Q\&A Cheatsheet**

---

## üîπ **Basic Node.js**

**1. What is Node.js?**

* Node.js is a **runtime environment** built on **V8 JavaScript engine** that allows running JS outside the browser.
* It uses an **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model** ‚Üí great for scalable apps.

---

**2. Difference between Node.js and JavaScript in browser?**

* Browser JS ‚Üí manipulates DOM, no access to filesystem.
* Node.js ‚Üí backend tasks (files, DB, network). No DOM.

---

**3. What is npm?**

* Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js.
* `dependencies` ‚Üí required in production.
* `devDependencies` ‚Üí needed only for development (tests, build tools).

---

**4. CommonJS vs ES Modules?**

* CommonJS ‚Üí `require()`, synchronous.
* ES Modules ‚Üí `import/export`, asynchronous, modern standard.

---

**5. What are callbacks?**

* Functions passed as arguments, executed later (async).
* Can lead to **callback hell** ‚Üí solved using Promises/async-await.

---

**6. What is the Event Loop?**

* Mechanism that allows Node.js to handle **non-blocking I/O** in a single thread.
* Phases: timers ‚Üí I/O callbacks ‚Üí idle ‚Üí poll ‚Üí check ‚Üí close.

---
Great question üöÄ. The **Event Loop** is one of the most important concepts in Node.js, and understanding it will make a lot of things about async behavior (like `setTimeout`, promises, file I/O, etc.) crystal clear.

---

### **6.A. What is the Event Loop?**

* Node.js runs in a **single thread** (unlike Java or C# web servers that spawn many threads).
* To handle thousands of concurrent requests, it uses the **event loop**.
* The event loop continuously checks: ‚ÄúDo I have something to execute? Are there callbacks waiting? Do I have timers expired?‚Äù

That‚Äôs how Node.js achieves **non-blocking I/O**.

---

### **6.B. Phases of the Event Loop**

The loop executes in this order:

1. **Timers** ‚Üí executes `setTimeout`, `setInterval` callbacks.
2. **I/O callbacks** ‚Üí handles I/O finished tasks (e.g., network, filesystem).
3. **Idle, prepare** ‚Üí internal stuff.
4. **Poll** ‚Üí waits for new I/O events (like incoming requests).
5. **Check** ‚Üí executes **setImmediate** callbacks.
6. **Close callbacks** ‚Üí executes `socket.on('close', ...)` etc.

---

### **6.C. Practical Example**

Let‚Äôs see code to watch it in action:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const net = require("net");

console.log("1. Start");

// ---------------- PHASE 1: TIMERS ----------------
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("4. setTimeout callback (Timers phase)");
}, 0);

// ---------------- PHASE 5: CHECK ----------------
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log("6. setImmediate callback (Check phase)");
});

// ---------------- PHASE 2: I/O CALLBACKS ----------------
// Async file read will trigger callback in I/O phase
fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  console.log("5. fs.readFile callback (I/O callbacks phase)");
});

// ---------------- MICROTASK QUEUE ----------------
// Runs before event loop continues
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("3. Promise.then callback (Microtask queue)");
});

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log("2. process.nextTick callback (Microtask - highest priority)");
});

// ---------------- TIMERS (INTERVAL) ----------------
let count = 0;
let timer = setInterval(() => {
  count++;
  console.log("Interval run:", count);

  if (count === 3) {
    clearInterval(timer); // stop after 3 times
  }
}, 0); // runs in Timers phase repeatedly

// ---------------- PHASE 4: POLL ----------------
// Poll is usually where I/O waits; we simulate it
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Extra Poll simulation (via timeout 10ms)");
}, 10);

// ---------------- PHASE 6: CLOSE CALLBACKS ----------------
const server = net.createServer().listen(0);
server.on("connection", (socket) => socket.end());
server.close(() => {
  console.log("7. server close callback (Close callbacks phase)");
});

console.log("8. End");

```

---

### **6.D. Expected Output**

The output will look like this (order may vary slightly depending on system, but promises always run **before timers/immediate**):

```
1. Start
8. End
2. process.nextTick callback (Microtask - highest priority)
3. Promise.then callback (Microtask queue)
4. setTimeout callback (Timers phase)
Interval run: 1
5. fs.readFile callback (I/O callbacks phase)
6. setImmediate callback (Check phase)
Extra Poll simulation (via timeout 10ms)
7. server close callback (Close callbacks phase)
Interval run: 2
Interval run: 3

```
### ‚úÖ Expected Execution Order (first tick of event loop)

1. `1. Start` (synchronous code)
2. `2. process.nextTick callback (Microtask - highest priority)`
3. `3. Promise.then callback (Microtask queue)`
4. `4. End` (sync finish)

---

**Event loop phases start:**

5. `Interval run: 1` (Timers phase, since interval=0)
6. `6. setTimeout callback (Timers phase)` (0ms timer)
7. `7. setImmediate callback (Check phase)`
8. `8. File read completed (Poll -> I/O callbacks phase)`
9. `Interval run: 2` (next Timers phase cycle)
10. `9. Poll phase (simulated by timeout inside poll)`
11. `Interval run: 3` (Timers phase again)
12. `10. server close callback (Close callbacks phase)`

    
‚ö†Ô∏è Key Notes  
* setInterval(..., 0) still waits until the next timers phase (it won‚Äôt block).  
* Execution order of setTimeout(‚Ä¶, 0) and setInterval(‚Ä¶, 0) can sometimes flip because they both sit in the same timers queue.
* In practice, you‚Äôll almost always see setTimeout first, then setInterval.

---

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**
* `process.nextTick` always wins inside the current tick.
* `Promise.then` runs after `nextTick`, before timers.
* `setInterval(..., 0)` will run **every timers phase** (not continuously).
* `setTimeout(..., 0)` fires once in the **first timers phase**.
* `setImmediate` executes in **check phase**, which usually comes after timers if no blocking I/O.
* `fs.readFile` callback executes in the **I/O callbacks phase (poll)**.
* `server.close` executes in the **close callbacks phase**, always last.

---

**7. What are Streams?**

* Handle data **piece by piece** instead of loading all at once.
* Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform.

---

**8. What are Buffers?**

* Temporary storage for **binary data**.
* Useful for files, network packets, etc.

---

## üîπ **Intermediate Node.js**

**9. How does Node.js handle concurrency if single-threaded?**

* Uses **event loop + libuv thread pool** for async I/O.
* Heavy CPU tasks ‚Üí offloaded to worker threads.

---

**10. process.nextTick() vs setImmediate()?**

* `process.nextTick()` ‚Üí runs **before** next event loop iteration.
* `setImmediate()` ‚Üí runs **after** current event loop completes.

---

**11. What is middleware in Express?**

* Functions that run **between request and response**.
* Example: logging, authentication, error handling.

---

**12. Common built-in modules?**

* `fs`, `path`, `http`, `os`, `events`, `crypto`, `util`.

---

**13. Sync vs Async functions?**

* Sync ‚Üí blocks execution until finished.
* Async ‚Üí non-blocking, executed later via callbacks/promises.

---

**14. How does error handling work?**

* `try/catch` for sync & async/await.
* `.catch()` for Promises.
* Event emitter‚Äôs `error` event for streams.

---

**15. What is clustering in Node.js?**

* Running multiple Node.js processes to use **multi-core CPUs**.
* Each process has its own event loop.

---

**16. Difference from multi-threaded servers (Java/.NET)?**

* Node.js uses **single-thread + async I/O**.
* Java/.NET use multiple threads for concurrency.

---

**17. fork() vs spawn() vs exec()?**

* `spawn` ‚Üí runs command, streams output.
* `exec` ‚Üí runs command, buffers output in memory.
* `fork` ‚Üí creates a new Node.js process for IPC.

---

**18. JWT authentication?**

* JSON Web Tokens ‚Üí signed tokens used for stateless authentication.
* Stored in headers (Authorization: Bearer).

---

**19. What is CORS?**

* Restricts cross-origin requests.
* In Node.js, handle via `cors` middleware.

---

**20. REST vs GraphQL?**

* REST ‚Üí fixed endpoints, multiple round trips.
* GraphQL ‚Üí single endpoint, query exact data.

---

## üîπ **Advanced Node.js**

**21. How does V8 work?**

* Compiles JS ‚Üí machine code (JIT).
* Handles memory allocation + garbage collection.

---

**22. Node.js memory management?**

* Managed by V8: heap + stack.
* GC removes unused objects.

---

# 23 What is **libuv**?

**libuv** is a small C library that Node.js uses to provide:

* A **cross-platform event loop** (works the same on Linux/macOS/Windows).
* A unified abstraction over OS I/O mechanisms

  * Linux: `epoll`, BSD/macOS: `kqueue`, Windows: `IOCP`, etc.
* A **work queue + thread pool** for operations that can‚Äôt be made non-blocking at the OS level (e.g., many filesystem calls, `getaddrinfo()` DNS lookups, compression, crypto).

Think of libuv as Node‚Äôs ‚Äúengine room‚Äù: it waits for events (sockets, timers), dispatches callbacks, and offloads blocking work to a small pool of worker threads so the **single JavaScript thread** stays responsive.

---

# 23.A. Where do **async/await** fits?

* `async/await` is **JavaScript syntax** over **Promises**. It doesn‚Äôt create threads.
* When you `await` something that ultimately touches the OS (e.g., `fs.promises.readFile`), Node‚Äôs **C++ bindings** call into **libuv**:

  1. The JS call returns a **Promise** immediately.
  2. libuv **submits a request** (often to its thread pool).
  3. The event loop keeps running.
  4. When the work finishes, libuv **posts a completion** back to the main loop.
  5. Node **settles the Promise** (resolve/reject) ‚Üí V8 schedules a **microtask**.
  6. Your `async` function **resumes after `await`** on the same JS thread.

So: libuv handles the *I/O and threading*, V8 handles the *Promise/microtask resumption*, and `async/await` is just the *nice syntax* you write.

---

# 23.B.What goes to the **thread pool** (and why)?

Some operations cannot be watched with non-blocking OS events; they would block the loop if run directly. libuv offloads these to its **worker pool** (default size **4**, configurable with `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` before Node starts):

* Most **filesystem** ops: `readFile`, `writeFile`, `stat`, `readdir`, etc. (POSIX FS calls are blocking; offloaded to keep the loop free.)
* **DNS** `dns.lookup()` (uses the system resolver via `getaddrinfo()` ‚Üí blocking ‚Üí thread pool).
  *(Contrast: `dns.resolve()` uses c-ares and non-blocking sockets, not the pool.)*
* **Crypto** heavy hitters: `crypto.pbkdf2`, `scrypt`, `bcrypt` (via native addons), some `zlib` compression.
* Misc CPU-ish native work scheduled via `uv_queue_work()`.

**Networking (TCP/UDP/HTTP)** usually doesn‚Äôt use the thread pool: sockets are non-blocking and are watched by the event loop (epoll/kqueue/IOCP).

> Note: On Windows, libuv uses IOCP even for many filesystem operations; abstraction still ensures the JS thread doesn‚Äôt block.

---

# 23.C. Step-by-step: `await fs.promises.readFile()`

```js
async function load() {
  const text = await fs.promises.readFile("data.txt", "utf8");
  console.log(text);
}
load();
```

1. JS enters `load()`, creates a **Promise**.
2. Node‚Äôs FS binding calls `uv_fs_read` (libuv).
3. libuv **queues** the read onto the **thread pool**.
4. Event loop keeps spinning; your JS thread is free.
5. Worker thread does the blocking `read()` syscall.
6. When done, the worker posts a **completion** to the loop.
7. Node resolves the Promise ‚Üí **microtask** runs ‚Üí `await` resumes ‚Üí `console.log(text)`.

---

# 23.D. Pool size, saturation & performance gotchas

Default pool size is **4**. If you run several **CPU-heavy** pool jobs, you can **starve** other pool users (like FS). Classic demo:

```js
const fs = require('fs/promises');
const crypto = require('crypto');

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  crypto.pbkdf2('p', 's', 1e6, 64, 'sha512', () => {
    console.log('pbkdf2 done', i);
  });
}

// This FS read may be delayed until a worker is free:
fs.readFile('big.txt').then(() => console.log('file read done'));
```

Because there are 4 pbkdf2 jobs and the pool size is 4, the file read can wait.
**Fixes/options:**

* Increase pool: `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node app.js` (max 128 in modern Node; older docs mention up to 1024 for libuv but Node clamps lower‚Äîkeep it reasonable).
* Avoid heavy CPU work in the pool; move CPU-bound work to **Worker Threads** (true parallel JS).
* Pipeline / rate-limit your heavy tasks.

---

# 23.E.  How timers & microtasks interleave with libuv work

* After each libuv phase (timers, I/O, check, etc.), Node/V8 drain **microtasks** (Promises) and **`process.nextTick`**.
* `process.nextTick` runs **before** Promise microtasks.
* Pool completions land in the **I/O callbacks** phase, which then resolve Promises ‚Üí your `await` resumes as a microtask.

**Priority (within a tick) roughly:**

1. Current callback‚Äôs sync code
2. `process.nextTick` queue
3. Promise microtasks
4. Move to next libuv phase (timers ‚Üí I/O ‚Üí check ‚Üí close‚Ä¶)

---

# Quick mental model

* **Event loop**: watches sockets/timers; dispatches callbacks.
* **Thread pool**: does blocking FS, DNS, crypto/zlib, custom native work.
* **async/await**: Promise syntax; resumes when libuv signals completion ‚Üí Promise settled ‚Üí microtask ‚Üí continue.

---

# 23.F. Practical tips

* **Don‚Äôt** assume `async/await` = multithreading. JS still runs on one thread (unless you use **Worker Threads**).
* For **I/O-bound** work: `async/await` + libuv is perfect.
* For **CPU-bound** work: prefer **Worker Threads** or processes; don‚Äôt flood the libuv pool.
* If you mix heavy crypto/compression with lots of FS: **tune** `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` and/or **isolate** heavy work.

---

# Bonus: show concurrency with `Promise.all`

```js
// Runs 10 reads concurrently; each read uses a pool worker,
// but they complete as workers free up.
await Promise.all(
  Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) =>
    fs.promises.readFile(`files/${i}.txt`, 'utf8')
  )
);
```

This doesn‚Äôt create 10 JS threads; it schedules 10 libuv requests, and the pool + OS handle them without blocking the JS thread.
---
Perfect, this is a **very practical consideration**. Node.js is amazing for certain workloads, but it‚Äôs **not ideal for everything**. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully.

---

## üîπ Node.js Strengths

Node.js is best for:

1. **I/O-bound tasks** (network, database, filesystem)

   * Handling thousands of simultaneous connections with minimal threads.
   * Examples: HTTP APIs, WebSockets, streaming, chat servers.

2. **Real-time applications**

   * Chat apps, live dashboards, collaborative tools, notifications.

3. **Single-page application backends**

   * APIs serving JSON, microservices.

> The key: Node.js **shines when you have many concurrent operations but most of the time they are waiting on I/O**.

---

# 23.ZAüîπ Cases where Node.js is **not ideal**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CPU-bound / heavy computation

* Node.js runs JavaScript on a **single thread** (main thread).
* Even though it has a **libuv thread pool**, it‚Äôs limited (default 4 threads).
* Heavy computation can **block the event loop**, making all requests slow.

**Examples:**

* Image/video processing
* Complex math / machine learning tasks
* Large encryption / decryption tasks
* Any operation that takes seconds on the main thread

**Problem:** All other requests (HTTP, timers) will **stall until computation is done**.

**Solution:** Offload heavy CPU work to:

* Worker Threads (`worker_threads` module)
* External services / microservices in another language (e.g., Python, C++)

---

### 23.ZB 2Ô∏è‚É£ Long-running synchronous blocking code

```js
// BAD: blocks the event loop
const data = fs.readFileSync("bigfile.txt"); // blocks for seconds
```

* Any blocking synchronous API (e.g., `readFileSync`, `crypto.pbkdf2Sync`) will freeze Node for all clients.
* Async alternatives exist (`fs.promises.readFile`, `crypto.pbkdf2`) ‚Üí Node remains responsive.

---

### 23.ZC3Ô∏è‚É£ Applications requiring **true multithreading for concurrency**

* Node.js is **single-threaded by default**.
* If you need multiple cores to compute in parallel **without splitting tasks manually**, Node.js is cumbersome.

**Alternatives:**

* Java, Go, Rust, C++ (true multithreaded concurrency built-in)

---

### 23.ZD4Ô∏è‚É£ Memory-intensive applications

* Node.js keeps **all objects in V8 heap**, which is limited (\~1.5GB for 64-bit default).
* Very large in-memory datasets can crash the process.

**Alternatives:** Languages/runtime with better memory control (Java, .NET, Rust).

---

### ‚úÖ Quick summary table

| Use case                           | Node.js suitability |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| High concurrency, I/O-bound        | ‚úÖ Ideal             |
| CPU-bound / heavy computation      | ‚ùå Not ideal         |
| Long blocking sync operations      | ‚ùå Not ideal         |
| Large in-memory datasets           | ‚ö† Limited           |
| Real-time apps / chat / websockets | ‚úÖ Ideal             |

---

### ‚ö° Rule of thumb

> **If your workload mostly waits on I/O**, Node.js is excellent.
> **If your workload mostly computes**, Node.js may **block** the event loop, so consider Worker Threads or another language/runtime.
