## 📌 **Basic Node.js Questions**
### **1. What is Node.js?**

* **Node.js** is a **JavaScript runtime** built on Chrome’s V8 engine.
* It allows you to run **JavaScript on the server**, not just in the browser.
* It’s **event-driven**, **non-blocking**, and ideal for **I/O-heavy applications** like APIs, real-time apps, and streaming services.

### **2. Key Features**

* **Asynchronous & Event-driven:** Handles multiple requests without blocking.
* **Single-threaded:** Uses event loop for handling concurrency.
* **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Vast ecosystem of packages.
* **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, Mac, Linux.

### **3. Core Modules**

* `fs` – File system operations
* `http` – Create web servers
* `path` – Handle file paths
* `os` – OS-related info
* `events` – Event emitter

### **4. Common Uses**

* RESTful APIs & GraphQL servers
* Real-time apps (chat, collaboration tools)
* Microservices
* CLI tools
* Streaming apps

### **5. Node.js Architecture**

* **Single-threaded event loop** handles concurrent requests.
* **Non-blocking I/O** allows high scalability.
* Works well with JSON-based communication (APIs).

### **6. Popular Frameworks**

* **Express.js** – Minimal and flexible web framework.
* **NestJS** – Enterprise-level Node.js framework (like Angular for backend).
* **Koa.js** – Lightweight, modern framework.
* **Fastify** – High-performance web framework.


### ✔️ What actually uses the thread pool?

Libuv’s thread pool is only used for **specific built-in asynchronous operations**:

| Category                                            | Does it use thread pool? |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File system (`fs.*`)                                | ✅ Yes                    |
| Crypto (`pbkdf2`, `scrypt`, some hashing)           | ✅ Yes                    |
| DNS (`dns.lookup`)                                  | ✅ Yes                    |
| Compression (`zlib`)                                | ✅ Yes                    |
| User-defined JS logic                               | ❌ No                     |
| CPU-heavy loops (sorting, calculating primes, etc.) | ❌ No                     |
| JSON.parse/stringify for huge data                  | ❌ No                     |
| Large array or string processing                    | ❌ No                     |

### ⚠️ Why heavy JS computation cannot be moved to the thread pool?
2. **What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript in the browser?**


3. **What is npm (Node Package Manager)?**

   * Difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.

4. **What is the difference between CommonJS (`require`) and ES Modules (`import`)?**
## ✅ **CommonJS (CJS)**

CommonJS is the **older module system** used in Node.js.

* Uses `require()` and `module.exports`
* Loads modules **synchronously at runtime**
* Node.js default before ES modules

**Example:**
```js
const math = require('./math');
module.exports = { add, subtract };
```
---

## ✅ **ES Modules (ESM)**
ES Modules is the **modern JavaScript module system** used in browsers and now Node.js.
* Uses `import` and `export`
* Loaded **asynchronously and statically**
* Better for optimization and modern development

**Example:**
```js
import math from './math.js';
export const add = () => {};
```
## 🧩 **One-line difference**

> **CommonJS** = old Node.js module system (require/export).
> **ESM** = modern JavaScript module system (import/export).

5. **What are callbacks, and why are they used in Node.js?**
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation completes.
In Node.js, callbacks are very common because many operations are asynchronous (file operations, database queries, API calls, timers, etc).

```node
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback(); // Execute the callback function
}

greet("Mohan", function() {
  console.log("Welcome!");
});

O/S
Hello Mohan
Welcome!
```
**5.A) Callback Hell?**
Callback Hell happens when multiple async operations depend on each other and callbacks get nested inside other callbacks, making the code:

Deeply indented
Hard to read
Hard to debug
Hard to maintain
This is also known as:
“Pyramid of Doom”

Real-World Example of Callback Hell

- Imagine we want to:
- Read a user from DB
- Fetch their orders
- Get details of each order
- Write the result to a file

* In old-style Node.js callbacks, it may look like this:
```node
const fs = require("fs");

function getUser(id, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("User fetched");
    callback(null, { id: id, name: "Mohan" });
  }, 1000);
}

function getOrders(user, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Orders fetched");
    callback(null, ["Order1", "Order2"]);
  }, 1000);
}

function getOrderDetails(order, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Order details fetched");
    callback(null, order + " Details");
  }, 1000);
}

getUser(1, function (err, user) {
  getOrders(user, function (err, orders) {
    getOrderDetails(orders[0], function (err, details) {
      fs.writeFile("result.txt", details, function (err) {
        console.log("File written!");
      });
    });
  });
});

```

**5.B ✅ Modern Fix: Use Promises or async/await**

The same logic using async/await becomes:
const fs = require("fs").promises;

```node
async function run() {
  const user = await getUser(1);
  const orders = await getOrders(user);
  const details = await getOrderDetails(orders[0]);
  await fs.writeFile("result.txt", details);
  console.log("File written!");
}

run();
```
**5.C await for task and Parallel execution with promise C**
```node
const task1Promise = task1(); //task1 is a async function
const task2Promise = task2(); //task2 is a async function

const result1 = await task1Promise;
const result2 = await task2Promise;

//or even 
const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([task1(), task2()]);

```
